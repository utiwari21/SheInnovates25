# **SkillMatch: Eliminating Bias in Hiring**

---

### **Inspiration**
As computer science students, we know firsthand how tough the job market can be—constantly applying, facing rejections, and wondering if bias played a role. Too often, candidates are judged based on demographics rather than their skills and experience. **SkillMatch** was built to change that. Our goal is to eliminate hiring bias so that talent and hard work are what truly matter. Additionally, we want to ensure fair pay, as many employees are overworked and underpaid.

### **What It Does**
**SkillMatch** anonymizes resumes by removing personal details such as name, gender, and ethnicity, ensuring that hiring decisions are based purely on skills and experience. It also provides a fair salary recommendation based on industry standards per city, company benchmarks, and the candidate’s qualifications. By implementing **SkillMatch**, companies can create a more equitable hiring process, reducing bias and ensuring employees are compensated fairly.

### **How We Built It**
We built **SkillMatch** using:

- **Flask and Python** for the backend, integrating the Gemini API to handle resume processing and anonymization.
- **React** for the frontend, crafting an intuitive, user-friendly interface.
- **TailwindCSS** for styling, ensuring a sleek, responsive design.

This tech stack allowed us to seamlessly connect the user input with backend processes while maintaining a smooth, dynamic user experience.

### **Challenges We Ran Into**
- Connecting the **frontend** to the **backend** was a time-consuming process. Ensuring seamless data flow between React and Flask required careful configuration.
- Efficiently **storing and managing data** was another hurdle, especially when it came to handling the original resume, anonymized summary, and unique resume ID.
- Balancing **data storage** with **smooth user interactions** required constant troubleshooting and fine-tuning.
